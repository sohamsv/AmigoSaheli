- For my New project business, AmigoSaheli, my team and I created a platform that aims to bridge the assistance gap in Germany while providing a sustainable and beneficial service for all involved parties. Our initiative offers support services for a nominal fee and includes tasks such as accompanying individuals to the doctor or helping with errands.
- We have established a clear business structure utilizing a commission-based model to ensure effectiveness and fairness in distributing responsibilities and benefits. Additionally, our promotional strategies include surveys to understand community-specific needs, social media campaigns for wider reach, and collaboration with university support networks.
- Implementing digital models has been a significant challenge. However, we have identified key elements such as identifying our initial customer base, content creation, and team roles to consider while designing digital tools like our website and app. Social media analytics tools also help us to track engagement and refine our approach based on real-world feedback and data analysis. Our aim is to create a data repository and establish a reliable data repository for both service providers and recipients.
- Our key findings include identifying our initial customer base through research and surveys and utilizing targeted advertising and collaborations with influencers for effective outreach. We have also focused on clear agreements, promotion ef forts, and team roles to streamline our operations and ensure that all aspects of the project are covered.
- Our project team comprises remarkable members, including Jai Prakash, Hernan Mauricio Leon Barreto, Surabhi Kailas Sangore, Soham Sanjay Vaidya, and Chetan Harshal Tote. We have worked hard to create a platform that we believe will revolutionize the assistance gap in Germany and support our elderly community.
